Description:
    Generates a blog based on the Infopark Kickstarter widget framework. The
    blog also supports disqus comments that can be enabled by entering the
    disqus shortname on the blog object. You can also set an optional author
    which is either the WebCRM login or email. The author is displayed with its
    gravatar image, if available. A RSS discovery link is placed in the layout
    file to get the blog feed.

Example:
    `rails generate cms:component:blog`
    `rails generate cms:component:blog --cms_path=/website/en`
